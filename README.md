🏎️🤖 Grand Prix AI Mystery

                                                      


“Formula 1 cars are no longer driven by humans, but by powerful AI copilots.
In the final lap, sabotage strikes. One AI turned traitor. Can you solve the mystery before it’s too late?”

📖 Game Overview

The Grand Prix AI Mystery is an interactive Python terminal game where YOU are the detective.
Four rival AI copilots once raced side by side:

🎯 GPT4 – The strategist, always 10 steps ahead.

🔗 LangChain – The orchestrator of communication.

🎨 DALLE – The artist who turned data into dazzling visuals.

📚 BERT – The linguist, a master of language yet too literal.

But one of them sabotaged the race… and it’s your mission to uncover who.

🎮 Gameplay Flow

Read the backstory and suspect profiles.

You have 2 chances to guess the culprit.

Type "hint" to unlock a clue — but first, solve an AI-themed riddle!

Catch the culprit before you run out of guesses.
